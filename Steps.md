### 1. Create a Dedicated Training File
First, choose or create a file where you want to store your ongoing bash_history. Let's call this file training_history.txt. You can create this file in your home directory or any other suitable location.


### 2. Write a Script to Append New Entries
You'll need to write a script that:

Reads the current bash_history.
Compares it with what's already in training_history.txt.
Appends any new entries to training_history.txt.
Here's a basic outline for such a script in Bash:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Paths to the bash_history and the training history file
BASH_HISTORY=~/.bash_history
TRAINING_HISTORY=~/training_history.txt

# Append new entries to the training history file
comm -13 <(sort $TRAINING_HISTORY | uniq) <(sort $BASH_HISTORY | uniq) >> $TRAINING_HISTORY

```
This script uses comm to compare sorted and unique lines from both files and appends any new lines from bash_history to training_history.txt.


### 3. Set Up a Cron Job
To automate the running of this script, you can use a cron job which will execute it at regular intervals.

First, make your script executable:
```
chmod +x /path/to/your/script.sh

```
Open your crontab file:
```
crontab -e

```
Add a line to run your script at a desired frequency. For example, to run it every hour, you might add:
```
0 * * * * /path/to/your/script.sh
```

### 4. Test Your Setup
After setting up the cron job, monitor training_history.txt to ensure that new entries are being appended as expected.

### To refine the search functionality of your script to handle more specific queries like "gubuster common.txt", you can modify the script to search for multiple keywords in a single command line. This approach requires processing each line of your training_history.txt and checking if it contains all the specified keywords
```
#!/bin/bash

# Path to the training history file
TRAINING_HISTORY=~/training_history.txt

# Function to check if a line contains all keywords
containsAllKeywords() {
    local line=$1
    shift
    for keyword in "$@"; do
        if [[ $line != *$keyword* ]]; then
            return 1
        fi
    done
    return 0
}

# Main search logic
searchHistory() {
    while IFS= read -r line; do
        if containsAllKeywords "$line" "$@"; then
            echo "$line"
        fi
    done < "$TRAINING_HISTORY"
}

# Execute the search with provided arguments
searchHistory "$@"

```

### Stuff to consdier based on collected data

Duplicate Commands: Depending on how you use the Bash shell, your bash_history might contain a lot of duplicate commands. You might want to consider whether to keep these duplicates (which could be useful for frequency analysis) or to filter them out.

Command Timestamps: If you want to analyze command usage over time, consider configuring your Bash to include timestamps in the bash_history. You can do this by setting the HISTTIMEFORMAT environment variable in your .bashrc file.

Security and Privacy: Be mindful of the commands you run. Some might contain sensitive information, which you might not want to store in training_history.txt.
